# Filler

I created this project to experiment with creating an RL agent to beat the game Filler (example: <https://apkpure.com/filler-game/org.caeex.filler).>
More to come soon.

Currently, the player can play against an AI player or let it play against another AI player.
The AI player does a depth-first search to select the best action to take.

## How to play

Run `python filler.py` to play.
