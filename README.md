# Filler

I created this project to experiment with creating an RL agent to beat the game Filler (example: <https://apkpure.com/filler-game/org.caeex.filler).>
More to come soon.

Currently, both the "players" do a depth-first search until a depth of 2 to find the best action to take.

## How to play

Run `python filler.py` to play.
